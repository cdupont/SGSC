\todo{change the conclusion}

In this paper we presented the SFA, a concept able to describe the flexibility of applications.
This format includes the trade-off between amount of resources allocated to a PaaS scalable application and the corresponding user experience, in a simple way.
This allows the PaaS framework to perform a multi-criteria optimizations such as lowering the global energy consumption of the data centre, using more renewable energies and increasing the application user satisfaction.
As future work, we will design the proposed API and components within the Cloud Foundry framework.
