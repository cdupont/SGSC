	abstract = {With the advent of new computing technologies, such as cloud computing and contemporary parallel processing systems, the building blocks of computing systems have become multi-dimensional. Traditional scheduling algorithms based on a single-resource optimization like processor fail to provide near optimal solutions. The efficient use of new computing systems depends on the efficient use of all resource dimensions. Thus, the scheduling algorithms have to fully use all resources. In this paper, we propose a queuing mechanism based on a multi-resource scheduling technique. For that, we model multi-resource scheduling as a multi-capacity bin-packing scheduling algorithm at the queue level to reorder the queue in order to improve the packing and as a result improve scheduling metrics. The experimental results demonstrate performance improvements in terms of waittime and slowdown metrics.},

	title = {Towards Energy-aware {IaaS}-{PaaS} Co-design},
	abstract = {The wide adoption of the cloud computing paradigm plays a crucial role in the ever-increasing demand for
energy-efficient data centers. Driven by this requirement, cloud providers resort to a variety of techniques
to improve energy usage at each level of the cloud computing stack. However, prior studies mostly consider
resource-level energy optimizations in {IaaS} clouds, overlooking the workload-related information locked at
higher levels, such as {PaaS} clouds. In this position paper, we argue that cross-layer cooperation in clouds is
a key to achieving an optimized resource management, both performance and energy-wise. To this end, we
claim there is a need for a cooperation {API} between {IaaS} and {PaaS} clouds, enabling each layer to share specific
information and to trigger correlated decisions. We identify the drawbacks raised by such co-design objectives
and discuss opportunities for energy usage optimizations. Moreover, we outline the design of a set of extension
modules for Libcloud to serve as building blocks for cross-layer information sharing and cooperation.},

	title = {A Framework for the Coordination of Multiple Autonomic Managers in Cloud Environments},
	doi = {10.1109/SASO.2013.27},
	abstract = {One of the main reasons for the wide adoption of Cloud Computing is the flexibility in which resources and software services are provisioned on demand through the concept of elasticity. Implementing elasticity to tackle varying workloads while optimizing infrastructures (e.g. utilization rate) and fulfilling applications' requirements on Quality of Service still remains an open issue and should be addressed by self-adaptation techniques able to manage complexity and dynamism. However, since Cloud systems are organized indifferent but dependent Cloud layers, self-management decisions taken in isolation in a certain layer may indirectly interfere with the decision taken by an other layer and globally affect the performance of the whole Cloud stack. Indeed, non-coordinated managers may lead to conflicting decisions and consequently to non-desired states. This paper proposes a framework for the coordination of multiple autonomic managers in Cloud systems. This framework introduces two kinds of managers: (i) one for each application, and (ii)another for the infrastructure. To tackle the problem of interferences between these Cloud autonomic managers, we propose a coordination protocol based on inter-manager events and actions along with synchronization mechanisms. The goal is to improve the synergy between layers in a loose-coupling manner. We evaluated the approach through an experimental scenario on Grid'5000, a real physical infrastructure testbed. In this use case, we show that our framework improves the synergy between cloud systems while dealing with conflicting objectives and negative interferences.},

We present relevant efforts at the edge of state of the art technology, providing an encompassing overview of the trends they each follow. We also highlight pending challenges that will likely be addressed in new research efforts and present an ideal scalable cloud system.},

	abstract = {As a direct consequence of the increasing popularity of Cloud Computing solutions, data centers are amazingly growing and hence have to urgently face with the energy consumption issue. Available solutions rely on Cloud Computing models and virtualization techniques to scale up/down application based on their performance metrics. Although those proposals can reduce the energy footprint of applications and by transitivity of cloud infrastructures, they do not consider the internal characteristics of applications to finely define a trade-off between applications Quality of Service and energy footprint. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptation approach that considers both application internals and system to reduce the energy footprint in cloud infrastructure. Each application and the infrastructure are equipped with their own control loop, which allows them to autonomously optimize their executions. Simulations show that the approach may lead to appreciable energy savings without interfering on application provider revenues.},

	abstract = {Over the past years, Autonomic Computing has become very popular, especially in scenarios of Cloud Computing, where there might be several autonomic loops aiming at turning each layer of the cloud stack more autonomous, adaptable and aware of the runtime environment. Nevertheless, due to conflicting objectives, non-synchronized autonomic loops may lead to global inconsistent states. For instance, in order to maintain its Quality of Service, an application provider might request more and more resources while the infrastructure provider, due to power shortage may be forced to reduce the resource provisioning. In this paper, we propose a generic model to deal with the synchronization and coordination of autonomic loops and how it can be applied in the context of Cloud Computing. We present some simulation results to show the scalability and feasibility of our proposal.},
