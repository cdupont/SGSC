	abstract = {The wide adoption of the cloud computing paradigm plays a crucial role in the ever-increasing demand for
energy-efficient data centers. Driven by this requirement, cloud providers resort to a variety of techniques
to improve energy usage at each level of the cloud computing stack. However, prior studies mostly consider
resource-level energy optimizations in {IaaS} clouds, overlooking the workload-related information locked at
higher levels, such as {PaaS} clouds. In this position paper, we argue that cross-layer cooperation in clouds is
a key to achieving an optimized resource management, both performance and energy-wise. To this end, we
claim there is a need for a cooperation {API} between {IaaS} and {PaaS} clouds, enabling each layer to share specific
information and to trigger correlated decisions. We identify the drawbacks raised by such co-design objectives
and discuss opportunities for energy usage optimizations. Moreover, we outline the design of a set of extension
modules for Libcloud to serve as building blocks for cross-layer information sharing and cooperation.},

	doi = {10.1109/SASO.2013.27},
	abstract = {One of the main reasons for the wide adoption of Cloud Computing is the flexibility in which resources and software services are provisioned on demand through the concept of elasticity. Implementing elasticity to tackle varying workloads while optimizing infrastructures (e.g. utilization rate) and fulfilling applications' requirements on Quality of Service still remains an open issue and should be addressed by self-adaptation techniques able to manage complexity and dynamism. However, since Cloud systems are organized indifferent but dependent Cloud layers, self-management decisions taken in isolation in a certain layer may indirectly interfere with the decision taken by an other layer and globally affect the performance of the whole Cloud stack. Indeed, non-coordinated managers may lead to conflicting decisions and consequently to non-desired states. This paper proposes a framework for the coordination of multiple autonomic managers in Cloud systems. This framework introduces two kinds of managers: (i) one for each application, and (ii)another for the infrastructure. To tackle the problem of interferences between these Cloud autonomic managers, we propose a coordination protocol based on inter-manager events and actions along with synchronization mechanisms. The goal is to improve the synergy between layers in a loose-coupling manner. We evaluated the approach through an experimental scenario on Grid'5000, a real physical infrastructure testbed. In this use case, we show that our framework improves the synergy between cloud systems while dealing with conflicting objectives and negative interferences.},

Available solutions rely on Cloud Computing models and virtualization techniques to scale up/down application based on their performance metrics. Although those proposals can reduce the energy footprint of applications and by transitivity of cloud infrastructures, they do not consider the internal characteristics of applications to finely define a trade-off between applications Quality of Service and energy footprint. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptation approach that considers both application internals and system to reduce the energy footprint in cloud infrastructure. Each application and the infrastructure are equipped with their own control loop, which allows them to autonomously optimize their executions. Simulations show that the approach may lead to appreciable energy savings without interfering on application provider revenues.},

For instance, in order to maintain its Quality of Service, an application provider might request more and more resources while the infrastructure provider, due to power shortage may be forced to reduce the resource provisioning.

We ran simulations to explore the potential for data centres to adapt to dynamic electrical prices, variation in carbon intensity within an electrical grid, or the availability of local renewables. Using workloads from the Parallel Workloads Archive alongside real-world pricing data, we demonstrate potential savings on the cost of electricity ranging typically between 10-50\%. Adaptation to the variation in the electrical grid carbon intensity was not as successful, but adaptation to the availability of local renewables showed potential to significantly increase their use. In one example the fraction of power obtained from a local wind installation increased by 10-80\%.},

In this paper, we propose a queuing mechanism based on a multi-resource scheduling technique. For that, we model multi-resource scheduling as a multi-capacity bin-packing scheduling algorithm at the queue level to reorder the queue in order to improve the packing and as a result improve scheduling metrics.

	abstract = {Energy production must continuously match demand on the electric grid. A deficiency can lead to service disruptions, and a surplus can place tremendous stress on grid components, potentially causing major blackouts. To manage this balance, grid operators must increase or lower power generation, with only a few minutes to react. The grid balancing problem has also impeded the pace of integrating bountiful renewable resources (e.g., wind), whose generation is intermittent. An emerging plan to mitigate this problem is demand response, i.e., for grid operators to alter the electricity usage behavior of the masses through real-time price signals. But due to prohibitively high infrastructure costs and societal-scale adoption, tangible demand response mechanisms have so far been elusive. We believe that altering the usage patterns of a multitude of data centers can be a tangible, albeit initial, step towards affecting demand response. Growing in both density and size, today's data center designs are shaped by the increasing awareness of energy costs and carbon footprint. We posit that shifting computational workloads (and thus, demand) across geographic regions to match electricity supply may help balance the grid. In this paper we will first present a real grid balancing problem experienced in the Pacfic Northwest. We then propose a symbiotic relationship between data centers and grid operators by showing that mutual cost benefits can be accessible. Finally, we argue for a low cost workload migration mechanism, and pose overarching challenges in designing this framework.},

	abstract = {Due to the increasing use of Cloud computing services and the amount of energy used by data centers, there is a growing interest in reducing energy consumption and carbon footprint of data centers. Cloud data centers use virtualization technology to host multiple virtual machines ({VMs}) on a single physical server. By applying efficient {VM} placement algorithms, Cloud providers are able to enhance energy efficiency and reduce carbon footprint. Previous works have focused on reducing the energy used within a single or multiple data centers without considering their energy sources and Power Usage Effectiveness ({PUE}). In contrast, this paper proposes a novel {VM} placement algorithm to increase the environmental sustainability by taking into account distributed data centers with different carbon footprint rates and {PUEs}. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reduces the {CO}2 emission and power consumption, while it maintains the same level of quality of service compared to other competitive algorithms.},

	abstract = {Internet-scale distributed systems such as content delivery networks ({CDNs}) operate hundreds of thousands of servers deployed in thousands of data center locations around the globe. Since the energy costs of operating such a large {IT} infrastructure are a significant fraction of the total operating costs, we argue for redesigning {CDNs} to incorporate energy optimizations as a first-order principle. We propose techniques to turn off {CDN} servers during periods of low load while seeking to balance three key design goals: maximize energy reduction, minimize the impact on client-perceived service availability ({SLAs}), and limit the frequency of on-off server transitions to reduce wear-and-tear and its impact on hardware reliability. We propose an optimal offline algorithm and an online algorithm to extract energy savings both at the level of local load balancing within a data center and global load balancing across data centers. We evaluate our algorithms using real production workload traces from a large commercial {CDN}. Our results show that it is possible to reduce the energy consumption of a {CDN} by 51\% while ensuring a high level of availability that meets customer {SLA} requirements and incurring an average of one on-off transition per server per day. Further, we show that keeping even 10\% of the servers as hot spares helps absorb load spikes due to global flash crowds and minimize any impact on availability {SLAs}. Finally, we show that redistributing load across highly proximal data centers can enhance service availability significantly, but has only a modest impact on energy savings.},

The problem focuses on the allocation of virtual machines with time-variable resource demands on data centres, which are geographically distributed and where local energy prices and temperatures are changing over time. The objective is to find a good compromise between the number of migrations, the loads of the servers and the energy cost reduction possible by following the lowest energy prices over time. We present an extremely rich model that not only considers migration of virtual machines, but also does a full assignment of virtual machines to individual servers, which are placed in racks, which are themselves organised in specific aisles of a data centre at a specific location. We present a scalable Constraint Programming-based Large Neighbourhood Search ({CP}-{LNS}) approach to solving this problem. Our {CP}-{LNS} approach significantly out-scales two commercial optimisation systems and provides a practical approach to lowering electricity costs for multiple geographically distributed data centres.},

This work takes the challenge to reduce the electric bill of commercial web search engines operating on data centers that are geographically far apart. Based on the observation that energy prices and query workloads show high spatio-temporal variation, we propose a technique that dynamically shifts the query workload of a search engine between its data centers to reduce the electric bill.

	abstract = {To reduce datacenter energy consumption and cost, current practice has considered demand-proportional resource provisioning schemes, where servers are turned on/off according to the load of requests. Most existing work considers instantaneous (Internet) requests only, which are explicitly or implicitly assumed to be delay-sensitive. On the other hand, in datacenters, there exist a vast amount of delay-tolerant jobs, such as background/maintainance jobs. In this paper, we explicitly differentiate delay-sensitive jobs and delay tolerant jobs. We focus on the problem of using delay-tolerant jobs to fill the extra capacity of datacenters, referred to as trough/valley filling. Giving a higher priority to delay-sensitive jobs, our scheme complements most existing demand-proportional resource provisioning schemes. Our goal is to design an intelligent trough filling mechanism that is energy efficient and also achieves good delay performance. Specifically, we propose a joint dynamic speed scaling and traffic shifting scheme. The scheme does not need statistical information of the system, which is usually difficult to obtain. In the proposed scheme, energy cost saving comes from dynamic speed scaling, statistical multiplexing, electricity price diversity, and service efficiency diversity. In addition, good delay performance is achieved via load shifting and capacity allocation based on queue conditions. We show the efficiency of the proposed scheme by both analysis and simulation.},

We evaluate our solution in our test-bed that simulates a heterogeneous data center, using real-world request workload and real-world electricity prices. We show that our strategies achieve cost and energy saving of at least 21\% over a naive load balancing scheme that distributes requests evenly across data centers, and outperform existing solutions which either do not exploit the electricity market diversity or do not exploit data center hardware diversity.},

Specifically, we explore whether geographical load balancing can encourage use of ‚Äúgreen‚Äù renewable energy and reduce use of ‚Äúbrown‚Äù fossil fuel energy. We make two contributions. First, we derive three distributed algorithms for achieving optimal geographical load balancing. Second, we show that if the price of electricity is proportional to the instantaneous fraction of the total energy that is brown, then geographical load balancing significantly reduces brown energy use.

	abstract = {Popular Internet services are hosted by multiple geographically distributed data centers. The location of the data centers has a direct impact on the services' response times, capital and operational costs, and (indirect) carbon dioxide emissions. Selecting a location involves many important considerations, including its proximity to population centers, power plants, and network backbones, the source of the electricity in the region, the electricity, land, and water prices at the location, and the average temperatures at the location. As there can be many potential locations and many issues to consider for each of them, the selection process can be extremely involved and time-consuming. In this paper, we focus on the selection process and its automation. Specifically, we propose a framework that formalizes the process as a non-linear cost optimization problem, and approaches for solving the problem. Based on the framework, we characterize areas across the United States as potential locations for data centers, and delve deeper into seven interesting locations. Using the framework and our solution approaches, we illustrate the selection trade offs by quantifying the minimum cost of (1) achieving different response times, availability levels, and consistency times, and (2) restricting services to green energy and chiller-less data centers. Among other interesting results, we demonstrate that the intelligent placement of data centers can save millions of dollars under a variety of conditions. We also demonstrate that the selection process is most efficient and accurate when it uses a novel combination of linear programming and simulated annealing.},

	abstract = {Power efficiency is one of the main issues that will drive the design of data centers, especially of those devoted to provide Cloud computing services. In virtualized data centers, consolidation of Virtual Machines ({VMs}) on the minimum number of physical servers has been recognized as a very efficient approach, as this allows unloaded servers to be switched off or used to accommodate more load, which is clearly a cheaper alternative to buy more resources. The consolidation problem must be solved on multiple dimensions, since in modern data centers {CPU} is not the only critical resource: depending on the characteristics of the workload other resources, for example, {RAM} and bandwidth, can become the bottleneck. The problem is so complex that centralized and deterministic solutions are practically useless in large data centers with hundreds or thousands of servers. This paper presents \$(\{{\textbackslash}rm {ecoCloud}\})\$, a self-organizing and adaptive approach for the consolidation of {VMs} on two resources, namely {CPU} and {RAM}. Decisions on the assignment and migration of {VMs} are driven by probabilistic processes and are based exclusively on local information, which makes the approach very simple to implement. Both a fluid-like mathematical model and experiments on a real data center show that the approach rapidly consolidates the workload, and {CPU}-bound and {RAM}-bound {VMs} are balanced, so that both resources are exploited efficiently.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of achieving the optimal tradeoff between operation risk and expected energy cost for Internet data center ({IDC}) operators in deregulated electricity markets according to the risk preferences of {IDC} operators. To achieve the target above, we propose a risk-constrained stochastic programming decision framework. Then, we formulate a risk-constrained expected energy cost minimization problem with the uncertainties in spot price and workload. To solve the formulated problem, we use a decomposition-based cutting plane algorithm. Finally, extensive evaluations based on real-life data show the effectiveness of the proposed decision framework.},

	doi = {10.1109/CCGrid.2012.71},
	abstract = {With the advent of cloud computing and the need to satisfy growing customers resource demands, cloud providers now operate increasing amounts of large data centers. In order to ease the creation of private clouds, several open-source Infrastructure-as-a-Service ({IaaS}) cloud management frameworks (e.g. Open Nebula, Nimbus, Eucalyptus, Open Stack) have been proposed. However, all these systems are either highly centralized or have limited fault tolerance support. Consequently, they all share common drawbacks: scalability is limited by a single master node and Single Point of Failure ({SPOF}). In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of a novel scalable and autonomic (i.e. self-organizing and healing) virtual machine ({VM}) management framework called Snooze. For scalability the system utilizes a self-organizing hierarchical architecture and performs distributed {VM} management. Moreover, fault tolerance is provided at all levels of the hierarchy, thus allowing the system to self-heal in case of failures. Our evaluation conducted on 144 physical machines of the Grid'5000 experimental test bed shows that the fault tolerance features of the framework do not impact application performance. Moreover, negligible cost is involved in performing distributed {VM} management and the system remains highly scalable with increasing amounts of resources.},

	abstract = {Large public cloud infrastructure can utilise power which is generated by a multiplicity of power plants. The cost of electricity will vary among the power plants and each will emit different amounts of carbon for a given amount of energy generated. This infrastructure services traffic that can come from anywhere on the planet. It is desirable, for latency purposes, to route the traffic to the data centre that is closest in terms of geographical distance, costs the least to power and emits the smallest amount of carbon for a given request. It is not always possible to achieve all of these goals so we model both the networking and computational components of the infrastructure as a graph and propose the Stratus system which utilises Voronoi partitions to determine which data centre requests should be routed to based on the relative priorities of the cloud operator.},

      ABSTRACT = {A Grid information system should rely upon two basic features: the replication and dissemination of information about Grid services and resources, and an intelligent distribution of such information among Grid hosts. This paper examines an approach based on ant-based systems to replicate and map Grid services information on Grid hosts according to a given semantic classification of such services. Information is disseminated by agents (ants), which traverse the Grid by exploiting the P2P interconnections among Grid hosts. An entropy index is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed Ant-based Replication and MApping protocol (ARMAP), and control the dissemination of resource information. This approach enables the use of a semi-informed search algorithm which can drive query messages towards a cluster of peers having information about resources belonging to the requested class. A simulation analysis has been performed to evaluate the performance of the ARMAP protocol.},
