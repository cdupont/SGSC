- paper on energy optimization at PaaS level \\
- include also multi-level optimization ideas: how to split energy
}

In this paper, we exploit cloud computing as the computing backend to manage application/workload lifecycle and infrastructure in order to provide a more general framework for DC4City project and to address energy management. We present a cloud architecture based on CloudFoundry and OpenStack for DC4Cities project. 

We discuss better energy management via consolidation techniques and green energy availability. We highlight energy optimization within this architecture, including multi-level and multi-layer optimization at IaaS/PaaS.


--- to provide elasticity/scalability in terms of applications capacity and resource requirements, so apps can scale up/down to model adaptive behavior to renewables
