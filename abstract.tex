\todo{
- paper on energy optimization at PaaS level \\
- include also multi-level optimization ideas: how to split energy
}

Paper Proposal:

Cloud architecture based on CloudFoundry and OpenStack for DC4Cities project
Discussion on energy optimization within this architecture, including multi-level and multi-layer optimization
Connection to DC4Cities components, EASC, Working Mode, Activity Plan, etc.

application scaling based on DC4Cities command,
working mode definition in PaaS

CloudFoundry/PaaS components

CloudFoundry coordination/interaction in OpenStack
Application instances consolidation: using tools
Containers consolidation: tools


providing scenarios for these cases
