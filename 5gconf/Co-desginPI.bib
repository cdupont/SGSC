	abstract = {The wide adoption of the cloud computing paradigm plays a crucial role in the ever-increasing demand for
energy-efficient data centers. Driven by this requirement, cloud providers resort to a variety of techniques
to improve energy usage at each level of the cloud computing stack. However, prior studies mostly consider
resource-level energy optimizations in {IaaS} clouds, overlooking the workload-related information locked at
higher levels, such as {PaaS} clouds. In this position paper, we argue that cross-layer cooperation in clouds is
a key to achieving an optimized resource management, both performance and energy-wise. To this end, we
claim there is a need for a cooperation {API} between {IaaS} and {PaaS} clouds, enabling each layer to share specific
information and to trigger correlated decisions. We identify the drawbacks raised by such co-design objectives
and discuss opportunities for energy usage optimizations. Moreover, we outline the design of a set of extension
modules for Libcloud to serve as building blocks for cross-layer information sharing and cooperation.},
