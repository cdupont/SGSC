\section{Optimization}
\label{sec:optim}
\ms{I think we can remove this section. It is quite difficult to formulate our proposal at this stage.}

Using the previously described architecture, we can define the optimization to be performed in the data centre. \ms{not sure if we call this architecture, or proposal?}
We define $DC_{Energy}$, the total energy consumption of the data centre, $DC_{Happy}$, the total "happiness" of the data centre and finally $DC_{Brown}$ the consumption of brown energies of the data centre.

\ms{equations are not well defined and well established for energy optimization.}
\begin{equation}
DC_{Energy} =\sum_{time} \sum_{Apps} P_{WMs}
\label{eq:DCen}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
DC_{Happy} =\sum_{time} \sum_{Apps} H_{WMs}
\label{eq:DChappy}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
DC_{Brown} =\sum_{time} (\sum_{Apps} P_{WMs} \times R_{Brown})
\label{eq:DCbrown}
\end{equation}

The multi-criteria objective followed by the auto-scaler is as the following:

\begin{equation}
\left\{
  \begin{array}{rcr}
    Min & DC_{Energy} \\
    Max & DC_{Happy}  \\
    Min & DC_{Brown}  \\
  \end{array}
\right.
\label{eq:DCbrown}
\end{equation}
