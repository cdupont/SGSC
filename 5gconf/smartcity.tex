We need to put an additional section on Smart Cities... Why do they need to have data centres inside the city (and not in Finland), what does that imply in term of management, energy consumption, renewables, data security/privacy and governance...

Also a loose connection can be made with 5G/communications: 5G technologies are enabling yet more use of internet/videos/social media. This data is more and more processed in the Cloud. So DC located in the City near the base station = more responsiveness/less losses.

Perhaps we could also talk about the concept of "cloud edge" or mini-cloud located near a base station or a sensor network (in a smart city where a sensor network is deployed) or about a CDN (contend delivery network) and where energy efficiency is needed.
