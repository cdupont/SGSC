\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec: conclusion}
\todo{change the conclusion}

The PaaS Cloud paradigm and the corresponding frameworks are currently developing at high-speed.
As shown in this paper, they provide new opportunities for energy optimization.
We presented the SFA, a concept able to describe the flexibility of applications.
This format includes the trade-off between the amount of resources allocated to a PaaS scalable application, the resulting performance and the corresponding user experience, in a simple way.
This allows the PaaS framework to perform multi-criteria optimizations such as lowering the global energy consumption of the data centre, using more renewable energies and increasing the application user satisfaction.
As future work, we will design the proposed API and components within the Cloud Foundry framework.
